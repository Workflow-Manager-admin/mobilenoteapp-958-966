# Note Taking App - User Guide

Welcome to the Note Taking App! This guide will help you understand how to use the application effectively.

## Getting Started

When you first open the app, you'll see the Notes List screen. If you don't have any notes yet, you'll see a message indicating that no notes are available.

## Creating a New Note

To create a new note:

1. Tap the floating action button (+ icon) at the bottom-right corner of the screen
2. Enter a title for your note (optional)
3. Enter the content of your note
4. Tap the save icon in the app bar to save your note

## Viewing Your Notes

All your notes appear in a list on the home screen. Each note shows:
- The title (or "Untitled Note" if no title was provided)
- A preview of the note's content
- The last time the note was edited

## Reading a Note

To read a note, simply tap on it in the notes list. This will open the Note Detail screen, where you can see:
- The full title
- The complete content
- When the note was created and last updated

## Editing a Note

To edit an existing note:
1. Open the note by tapping on it in the list
2. Tap the edit icon in the app bar
3. Make your changes to the title or content
4. Tap the save icon to save your changes

## Deleting a Note

To delete a note:
1. Method 1: From the notes list, tap the delete (trash) icon next to the note
2. Method 2: Open the note and tap the delete icon in the app bar
3. Confirm that you want to delete the note

## Tips for Better Notes

- Use clear, descriptive titles to help you quickly identify your notes
- For longer notes, consider using formatting like bullet points or numbered lists
- Keep your most important notes at the top by editing them (this updates the "last modified" time)

## Backing Up Your Notes

Your notes are saved automatically on your device. However, to prevent data loss, consider:
- Exporting important notes to other apps occasionally
- Taking screenshots of critical information

## Performance Tips

- If your notes list becomes very long, consider deleting old and unnecessary notes
- Very long notes might load more slowly; consider splitting them into multiple notes if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues:
- Make sure your device has available storage space
- Try closing and reopening the app
- Check for app updates
- If problems persist, you might need to uninstall and reinstall the app (note that this may result in data loss)

Enjoy using the Note Taking App!
