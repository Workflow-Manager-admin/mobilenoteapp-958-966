# Note Taking App - Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues you might encounter when building or using the Note Taking App.

## Build Issues

### Flutter Command Not Found

**Problem:** The `flutter` command is not recognized.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that Flutter is installed by running `which flutter`
2. If not installed, follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
3. Ensure the Flutter bin directory is in your PATH: 
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER]/flutter/bin"
   ```
4. Restart your terminal or IDE

### Dependency Issues

**Problem:** Error messages related to missing packages or outdated dependencies.

**Solution:**
1. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch all dependencies
2. If issues persist, try deleting the `pubspec.lock` file and running `flutter pub get` again
3. Verify that all dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` are correctly formatted
4. Try upgrading Flutter with `flutter upgrade`

## Runtime Issues

### Notes Not Saving

**Problem:** Created notes are not being saved or don't appear in the list.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the note contains some content (empty notes might be filtered out)
2. Check if the device has sufficient storage space
3. Ensure the app has proper permissions to access local storage
4. Check for any errors during the save operation in the console/logs
5. Try clearing the app data and starting fresh (note: this will delete all existing notes)

### Data Persistence Issues

**Problem:** Notes disappear after app restart.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the `shared_preferences` package is correctly implemented
2. Verify that the save operation completes successfully
3. Check for any error messages in the console/logs
4. On Android, ensure the app has storage permissions
5. On iOS, verify that NSUserDefaults is working correctly

### UI Issues

**Problem:** UI elements not displaying correctly or overlapping.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're using the latest Flutter version
2. Check for widget overflow issues in your layout
3. Implement responsive design practices
4. Use Flutter inspector to debug layout issues
5. Test on different screen sizes

## Performance Issues

**Problem:** App becomes slow with many notes.

**Solution:**
1. Implement pagination for the notes list
2. Optimize note loading and saving operations
3. Consider using a more efficient storage solution for large datasets
4. Implement lazy loading for note content

## Device-Specific Issues

### Android

**Problem:** Storage permissions issues on Android.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure proper permissions are requested in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file
2. Request runtime permissions for storage if needed
3. For newer Android versions, consider using scoped storage approaches

### iOS

**Problem:** Notes not saving on iOS.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the app has the necessary entitlements
2. Ensure iCloud capabilities are properly configured if using iCloud storage
3. Check for any iOS-specific permission issues

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging** to get more detailed information about operations
2. **Use Flutter DevTools** to inspect the widget tree and track state changes
3. **Check the shared preferences data** to verify what's actually being saved
4. **Add explicit error handling** to catch and display issues
5. **Test incrementally** by adding small features and testing thoroughly before moving on
